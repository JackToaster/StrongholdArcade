# StrongholdArcade
An arcade-style game of the 2016 FRC game, FIRST Stronghold, made for FRC team 3641. This game was made with the Godot 2 game engine.
#
### Controls
Each player has a forward, backward, left, and right control, as well as two buttons. The red player uses the arrow keys and enter/backspace as the two buttons, and blue uses WASD, space, and X. The space and enter button fires a ball, starts the game, or enters a character in the high score entry. The X and backspace buttons delete a character in the high score entry screen. The X and backspace buttons are not necessary, but helpful.
#
### Gameplay
Both players control their robots to cross the defenses of the outer works, pick up balls by driving into them with the front end of their robot, and scoring the balls into the high and low goals of the castle. Each castle has a low goal on the outer two sides of the tower, and a high goal on all three sides of the tower. To shoot into the low goal, drive right up to the tower and fire. For the high goal, drive about half the distance to the outer works and fire at the tower. At the end of the game, more points can be gained by driving up to the tower as time expires. 
#
### Scoring
The scoring is the same as the real FRC game, which can be found here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIRST_Stronghold
The main difference is that capturing the tower only requires one robot, since there aren't three robots on each alliance.
